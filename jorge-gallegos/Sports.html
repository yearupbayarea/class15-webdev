    <h2>Soccer</h2>
    <p>I played Soccer a lot as a kid. The only position I was decent at was goalkeeper. I was never afraid of the ball. I was around 8 years old, playing with 15 and 16 year old kids. I remember a time when someone kicked the ball really hard directly at my face. I got a mild concussion and couldn't see out of my left eye for a few hours. It was pretty scary not being able to see. As the years went on I played soccer less and less every day. I eventually stopped and now only go when my friends go and play</p> 
    <h2>Basketball</h2>
    <p>I grew up playing a lot of Basketball. If I would have played games on my high school team, I would have been able to get a scholarship to play in college. Unfortuantely, I could not due to my heart condition. My doctor did not approve of me playing. However, that didn't stop me from playing Basketball. It was one of the only things I was really good at. In high school everybody was jealous of my jumpshot.My coach always complimented me on it, and a lot of people told me they wished they had my jumpshot.</p>
    <h2>Boxing</h2>
    <p>I took Boxing when I was 15. The community at those gyms is unbelievable. The people there are so nice and respectful. When it come to getting in the ring however, they are relentless. I have gotten whooped more times than I can remember, but I always had fun being in the ring. I learned a lot from boxing, like determination and discipline. It was one of the best experiences of my life.</p>
