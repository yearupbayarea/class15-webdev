    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Hey, my name is Jorge. I was born in Los Angeles, California. My parents moved to San Fransisco in when I was one and I've been living here ever since. I was a pretty quiet kid for the most part. I didn't really socialize much because I didn't share interests with a lot of people. I mostly kept to myself and played a lot of video games.</p> 
    <h2>Teen Years</h2>
    <p>During my teen years, I was a lot more outgoing, but still didn't like being with too many people. I still played a lot of video games and got more into computers. I tried coding for a little bit when I was around 13 but I never really got fully into it.I started getting back into when I heard about Year Up, but stopped again because I needed to get a job.</p>
