    <h2>High School</h2>
    <p>During my first two years in high school, I was the worst student. I would skip class a lot, show up late all the time and never did any of the work. At the en dof those two years, I the the credits of a 9th grader.something really clicked when a counselor pulled me off to the side and told me I wouldn't graduate if I didn't start doing better in school. I ended up having to transfer to Downtown High School, which is a continuation school. I had to work so hard to catch up on credits. I did every extra credit opportunity they offered me. I ended up catching up on all my credits and became the first one in my family to graduate from high school.This is the accomplishment I am most proud of today.</p> 
    <h2>Joining Year Up</h2>
    <p>Joining Year Up is next on my list of big accomplishments. At first I thought Year Up was a scam. I couldn't believe that they would pay me to go to school and teach me tech and professional skills. I had to wait two years for the right moment to join, but it finally happened. I signed up for an info session and loved everything about it. I met interns that had nothing but good things to say abput the program. I tried my best during the admission proccess to show that I really wanted this opportunity and that I waswilling to put in the work. Fortuantely I got accepted. I told my counselor right away and he was really happy for me. This was a really big step towards my future.     </p>
