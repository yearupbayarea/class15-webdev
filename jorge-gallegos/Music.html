    <h2>Genres</h2>
    <p>I like to listen to many different genres. Whatever genre it is, as long as it sounds good to me, I will listen to. I love listening to new music. I am just a little biased towards Raggae, but I'll listen to anything anybody suggests</p> 
    <h2>Raggae</h2>
    <p>I have been listening to a lot of Raggae lately and I always come back to the same two bands.It'e either I listen to Stick Figure or Tribal Seeds. Those are my two go-to bands when it comes to Raggae. I really like it because it puts me in a good and relaxed mood. One of my favorite songs is called "Weight of Sound" by Stick Figure.</p>
