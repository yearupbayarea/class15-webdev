<p>	During my first week of Year Up I did not know what to expect. It was an experience I have never had before. Many were open to share who they were, what their story was, and why they joined Year Up. Overall, I can't wait to continue to bond with my colleagues. </p>

<p>	My favorite class is Web Development. I enjoy the hands-on activities and the freedom to create with what you learn. Having learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I now have a basic understanding of what a website is. And with this knowledge I have the skills to design my own website.  </p>
