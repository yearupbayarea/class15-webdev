<p>Virgin Galactic is the first commercial spaceline. The company brings tourists up to space using a airplane carrier that holds a suborbital spacecraft. I find space facinating, and to be able to fly there is incredible. So, this is idea of bring people to space to me is something I'd love to get involved with.  </p>
