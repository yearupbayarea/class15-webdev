    <h2>A Peek into Feuy's Life</h2>
    <p>Hi, My name is Feuy Saeyang. I was born in Thailand on September 20th 1990. I came to the US with my family when I was 1 years old. I currently live in Oakland, CA with my family. I went to Oakland High School and graduated in 2008. Right after graduation, I got pregnant and gave birth to my son, Makaio Saeyang, at 18 years of age. I worked, went to school, and graduated from Heald College in 2011 with an AAS in Medical Assisting. </p>

    <h2>Life After College</h2>
    <p>I continued to work after I graduated from college. I didn't get a job or internship in my field of study, so I continued to work at KFC as a Shift Supervisor. I took in a second job as a caregiver and I worked from 8:30am - 10:30pm almost every day. I did that for about 3 months until I got promoted to Assistant Manager for KFC at a different store. I worked even longer hours after getting promoted. I would have to get up at 7am to get ready and drop my son off to his grandma then head to work. I worked from 8am to midnight 5-6 days a week. I continued to work at KFC for 6 months and then I found an Office Admin position at a Life Insurance office. So I worked there for 2.5 years until I got the opportunity to join Year Up.</p>
