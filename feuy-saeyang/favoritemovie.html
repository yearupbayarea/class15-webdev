    <h2>Korean Dramas</h2>
      <p>I love Korean Dramas! I love watching historical Korean dramas especially because it have action, romance, mystery and comedy. One of my personal favorite historical Korean drama is Dong Yi.
      </p>
      <p><em>Dong Yi</em> is such an amazing series. The main actress is not like the typical actress in most movies and tv shows who are weak and naive. She endured so much hardships after her father and brother were framed and executed for something that they didn't do. She is such an honest and strong young lady who also have so much knowledge. She does not give up and she will do everything she can to prove her.
