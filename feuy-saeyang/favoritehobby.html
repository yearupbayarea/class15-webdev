    <h2>Can you guess what it is?</h2>
  	 <p>I love going to the gym! I have been trying to get my body back in shape ever since I had my son which is more than 5 years ago. It's really hard to find the time to workout because there's just so much to do when you have a child. They need all of your attention and they drain all of your energy. 
  	 </p>
     <p>When I do find the time to do, I try to work every part of my body. The reason is, who knows when is the next time I'll be able to go back. That's why I use the stairmasters for about 15 - 20 minutes. Then I move on to do some crunches. After about 200 of those, I head over to the machines to workout my arm. When I first started going to the gym, I was not able to lift 20lbs! Can you believe that? I am slowing improving so hopefully I lose a couple of pounds soon.

    <h2>Spending Time with my Family</h2>
      <p>I used to work from 8am to midnight, so I didn't get to spend much time with my son. Whenever I'm off from work and school, I just want to relax and spend time with my family. My son used to be so attach to me that he wouldn't take his eyes off of me. He was afraid that I would leave him. That's why I just want to spend time with my family.
